MPPKDS--keypairs_analysis

## Real random numbers
We calculate up/down correlation coefficient of different key pairs based on 18 Maria primes：
107，227，449，809，1619，3203，6473，12809，25673，51329，102497，206369，412289，823553，1647617，3291137，6596609，13355009
These primes ware taken from Maria primes every 2^x * 100

# Conclusion
1. The average of up and down covariances of Maria's algorithm is around 0.5864
2. The performance of MPPK Algorithm is better than RSA, whose average of up and down covariances is around 0.6372 (The RSA pairs was generated by rsa_key_gen.py.   created by Tommy Zhou)
3. Increasing the modulo P doesn’t decrease the ReLU-activated correlations between private and public keys, which will allow ReLU activated deep learning network to learn the correlation


## Twin primes
We also calculate up/down correlation coefficient of “Maria brother primes": 2^x * q - 1, and "Maria sister primes": 2^x * q + 1 and their twins.
Interestingly, we found that at least one of the Maria's pair is a twin prime! (See Twin-Maria primes.xlsx   created by Prof.Jun Steed Huang)

# Conclusion
The result shows that correlation coefficients of twin primes are mostly smaller than Maria's primes. 
Since twin primes have greater integer complexity, the performance of twin primes may be better than Maria's primes.
