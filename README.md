# MPPKDS--keypairs_analysis

Digital Signature Performance ofa New Quantum Safe Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Algorithm ---

This part shows the average positive and negative correlations of MPPK/DS key pairs versus modulo values. We aim to find the key pairs with large relu correlation coefficient and use ReLU Neural Network to predict private keys.
