# MPPKDS--keypairs_analysis

Digital Signature Performance ofa New Quantum Safe Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Algorithm ---

This part shows the average positive and negative correlations of MPPK/DS key pairs versus modulo values. We aim to find the key pairs with large relu correlation coefficient and use ReLU Neural Network to predict private keys.

## Description

### Key Generation
The key is generated according to paper of A new quantum-safe multivariate polynomial public key digital signature algorithm.
The code is edited on Tommyâ€™s Python code.

### Semi-correlation coefficients

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

### Twin primes
